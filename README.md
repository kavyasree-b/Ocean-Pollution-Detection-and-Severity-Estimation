# Ocean-Pollution-Detection-and-Severity-Estimation
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect ocean pollution and estimate the severity level from images. It combines image preprocessing, data augmentation, and deep learning–based classification to support real-time environmental monitoring and awareness generation.

Features
 Pollution Detection: Classifies whether an ocean image contains pollution.
 Severity Estimation: Categorizes pollution into different severity levels (e.g., low, medium, high).
 CNN-Based Model: Trained on a structured dataset of ocean images with waste materials.
 Preprocessing Pipeline: Resizing, normalization, histogram equalization, and augmentation.
 Interactive Visualization Dashboard: Displays predictions, confidence scores, and example outputs.

Tech Stack
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
